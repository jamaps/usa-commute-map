## usa-commute-map

This map visualizes commutes in the USA in 2016 based on LEHD [data](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/), which was downloaded via [this](https://github.com/jamaps/lehd) Python library. The map was designed using [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/), the Generate XYZ Tiles tool to export tiles, and then placed into a [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) slippy map.
